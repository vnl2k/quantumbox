    "The concepts to be introduced in this notebook, such as the Ising model, simulated annealing, and the transverse Ising model, play an important role in today's quantum algorithms and quantum computing paradigms, including quantum annealing, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and quantum-enhanced sampling. Here we give some insight on how these physical building blocks work.\n",

    "# The Ising model\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to make a connection between the computational hardness of a problem and how difficult it is to solve a corresponding physical system. The Ising model is the most basic model to do this. It is an extensively studied model and one of the most basic examples to teach statistical mechanics and phase transitions, but we only require an elementary understanding of it.\n",

    "\n",
    "They will naturally anti-align: one will have north pole facing up, the second the south pole facing up. We can think of them as two binary variables, $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$. Say, if the north pole is facing up, we assign the value +1 to the variable, and -1 otherwise. To abstract away from magnets, in general, we call these variables spins. So in the optimal configuration, their product is -1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma_1\\sigma_2=-1 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of this as the energy of the system: the lowest energy is called the ground state energy. Note that there are two physical configurations corresponding to this optimum: $\\sigma_1=+1, \\sigma_2=-1$, and $\\sigma_1=-1, \\sigma_2=+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we keep adding more magnets to this system, we can sum up their pairwise interaction to get the total energy. The total energy of the system is called the Hamiltonian, and we will denote it by $H$. So if we have $N$ magnets arranged along a straight line, we have\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H=\\sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1}$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We did a simplification here: we assumed that remote magnets do not interact with each other, e.g. there is no such term as $\\sigma_i\\sigma_{i+2}$. In general, the interactions modeled depend on the layout of the spins and assumptions about the physical model: there will be some graph describing the connectivity of interactions. To reflect this, we write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H=\\sum_{<i,j>} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{j}$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $<i,j>$ typically means nearest neighbours, but it is up to us to declare what nearest neighbours mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now imagine that the distance is not the same between each pair. In other words, some pairs interact more than others. We can express this by adding a parameter that describes the interaction strength:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H=-\\sum_{<i,j>} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{j}$$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J_{ij}$ is a real number. We added a negative sign to the Hamiltonian: this is by convention. If the spins are antiferromagnetic, that is, they behave as we would expect from magnets, then all $J_{ij}$ values would be negative. That cancels out the negative sign of the sum, so we still expect that each product $\\sigma_i\\sigma_j$ would give you -1 in the optimum configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is fairly complicated by this point. Imagine that you have many spins and not all of them behave like magnets (that is, $J_{ij}$ can take both negative and positive values for different pairs). Nature still wants to find the lowest energy configuration, though. Let's take a look at how we would do it in code. Let's calculate the energy of spins on a line, given some couplings and a spin configuration:"

QUBOs are NP-hard in general, that is, we are not aware of an efficient polynomial time algorithm to solve any given QUBO. So the generic strategy is the exhaustive search we did above, which takes exponentially many steps in the number of sites (variables).\n",

This is what happens in metals if they are cooled down too quickly: the crystal lattice will have imperfections and the metal will not have the desired properties. A process called *annealing* helps in metallurgy: by increasing the temperature, the chance of overcoming the potential barrier increases and the crystal structure can reconfigure itself. If the barrier is high and the energy difference is small between the ground state and the first excited state, the probability of this happening drops. This is what it means that the problem is difficult to do in a physical system.\n",
